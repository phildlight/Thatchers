"On March 21, 1901 the Maine State Legislature passed "An Act to Establish a <a href="scans/maine1901-1909.gif"> State Flag </a> ." The flag was to include a Pine Tree centered on a buff colored field. Equidistant from the hoist and upper border of the flag a blue polar star was to be displayed.<p>

Interestingly, on February 23, 1909, the State Legislature adopted a new standard, describing the state flag as a display of the Maine coat of arms on a blue field. This is the flag in use today, more or less."<p>

I used the stock windows painted bone buff color, roof trim from AHM Rico depot (entire top rim), roof access stairs were AHM Ramsey Journal Building counter raised to minimum door height, ventilator was turned from plastic sprue, need to add one more round chimney in right front location.  Maine Winters must be cold! The extended store front was based on the original article pictures and defined by the AHM shed roof, Campbell HO 917 door and store window from kit used to make Neverly Sister's Rooming House bashed (AHM Emporium Department Store Corner building #5879). <br>
<b>Yes</b>, I added a back and dock that Bob and Dave did not have.  Also added the enclosed stairs and covered second floor balcony.  Tinted random bricks with variations from basic brick red color.  The far side had grey chalk morter added but it was not satisfactory for the entire building.  Will revisit when weathering to final location.

<i>Lineside supply shed</i> <b>Model Railroader</b>, September 1958 page 26 
by Jack Work <br> 
Could be done with Campbell Scale Models 200-370  Supply shed but need to modify the eave vent and use a tar paper roof instead of shingles, unless you REALLY like shingles like I do. <br>
2 1/2 x 5 1/4 inches.  
<blockquote><blockquote>
I got very excited when I ran across the article in an old Model Railroader by one of my favorite authors, Jack Work.  Of course I only recognized the building because I was in the middle of building the Campbell's kit, and struggeling to put ENOUGH bracing in the wood structure that the walls and roof could be stained with the Sweet and Sour method.  Vinegar & the cheapest steel wool that you can find make a great wood stain.  But you need to brace the structure every way you can so it will not warp too much. <br>
What Jack Work or Dave F call a three day build, takes me about a week.<p>
The unloading platform is very entertaining to build, with lots of detailed bracing underneath to spur interest.  On the positive side, I now feel confident I can add a similar unloading platform structure to the 8-ball locomotive works (building #5 above) and install the loafers to complete the structure.<br>  The windows and louvers are a utility grey, Campbells shingles were used insted of the TI grey tarpaper roof. Will turn a brass pin head down for the door knobs.

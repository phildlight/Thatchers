<h1>
Thatcher's Inlet Project
</h1>

An idea born of a series in RMC magazine starting with four articles written in 1972 by Bob Hayden and Dave Frary.  The challenge is to identify the buildings they used, then capture the spirit of their 6'6" by 3' layout in two 4' by 2' portable HOn30 modules, that will travel to California, by car or airplane.  
<br>
Someday, someone might say "you know, that reminds me of a layout I saw in an old RMC".

This was the layout that influenced me to get into HOn 2 1/2  (HOn30).

Thatcher's Inlet (1928):<br>
Population mentioned in RMC 1972 February, March, April and May<br>
<hr>
<b>Sam Cahoon</b><br>
- Owner of Cahoon's Fishhouse (Revell fat farmer figure)  <br>
Looks like he is closely related to <b> Eben Brown </b> of Elk River 
and younger brother of <b> Gus Cahoon</b> of the Sierra Pacific Railroad.  In Pictures of Brown's boat house (need ref to picture),Eben Brown appears to have male pattern baldness when he removes his hat. One could assume this is a family trait and might be usefull in Cahoon Geneology.
Presume Eban & Horace Brown are brothers, perhaps as close as cousins to Cahoon.  Unknown relationship to Ellis (Wallace) Brown<p>

<b>Francis Preston</b> <br>Remarked as young in 1928 working at Preston Fishouse doing meanial tasks.  There is a fine schooner at anchor in the Inlet named <b>Maude Preston</b> which is presummably the mother of Francis.<p>

<b>Sarah Buckley</b> <br>Owner of the popular "Seaman's Inn" in Thatcher's Inlet. Reportedly VERY good looking with a firery temper but a great cook of Down East fare.<p>

<b>Jimmy Whitworth</b><br> Fireman on the six coupled Thatcher's Inlet Steam Engine #5.<p>

<b>Frank Bunting</b><br> Engineer on TI Steam Engine #5.  Wears hobnail boots while at work.<p>

<b>Howard Bemis</b><br> Conductor on the Steam Engine TI #5. Known to be forgetfull and disorganized.<p>

<b>Wallace (Ellis?) Brown</b><br> Owns a house at the North end of Thatcher's Inlet next to Neverly Sister's rooming house.<p>

<b>Raymond Geary</b><br> Owns a small boat building and repair yard behind 
Cahoon's Fishhouse.  Has lived in TI since 1915 (the last 13 years in 1928). Still considered 'from away' by most folks in Town.<p>

<b>Ellis Turner</b><br> Owner of Turner's fish-head glue and fertilizer plant at the North End of Main Street in Thatcher's Inlet.  The motto is "You can tell by the smell" <p>

<b>Horace Savage</b><br> Lobsterman.  Owns a boat house (fishing shack) on the inlet, just off Beal's Street, about as far East as you can go in town.  In 1913 decided to ride out the hurricane Hilda at sea in his 32' Novy-hulled boat.  Ended up within 6 feet of the door to the TI firehouse (part of the Municipal Building) with a borrowed compass. His thick Maine accent stuptifies the visiting 'coneies'.<p>
<p>

<b>Eben Thatcher</b><br> Co-Owner of the 12 mile "Thatchers Inlet Railway" founded in 1893.  Father-in-law to Ellis Brown <p>

<b>Ellis (Wallace?) Brown</b><br> Born in 1871.  Co-Owner of the 12 mile "Thatchers Inlet Railway" founded in 1893. Son-in-law to Eben Thatcher.  This could be the same Wallace Brown that owns a house at the North end of Thatcher's Inlet next to Neverly Sister's rooming house. Also noted as owner of Brown's Boat Yard giving creedence to the rumored Cahoon / Brown family relationship.
<p>

<b>Ellie Turner</b><br> Owner of an old dog <b>Rufous</b> that likes to chase butterflies.  Most likely the heir apparent of Ellis Turner's Fish-head Glue and Fertilizer plant.<p>
 
<b>Odie Strunk</b><br>  Born in 1871. Has worked quite some time at Turner's Fish-head Glue and Fertilizer plant (some times called Freal's Fish Eye fertilizer and Turner's Glue Factory presumably from a previous seperate business before the consolidation under Turner's name) on the north end of Main street in Thatcher's Inlet. <p>

<b>Abner Beals</b><br> 
Weston Drunk on Lamp post figure <br>
Known to enjoy draft beer and clam bakes.  Owns a Model T Ford in 1928.<p>

<b>Virgil Doubleday</b><br>
Owns Virgil Doubleday's Fish Market on Main Street in Thatcher's Inlet.<p>

<b>Jerome McKue </b><br> Owns a fishing shack on the Inlet near Cahoon's Fishhouse.<p>

<b>Farley Gruen</b><br> Owns a fishing shack (boat house) on the West end of the Inlet near Preston's Fish House.  Based on RMC May 1972,pg 27 vs. RMC March 1972,pg 41, Mr. Gruen must have bought the boat house from Horace Savage before Mr Savage built the new one at the East end of the safe anchorage on the Inlet<p>

<b>Neverly Sisters</b> Owners of the Neverly Sister's rooming house on the North Main street.  They wear remarably little clothing in the chill of the landward breeze and they are very friendly.<p>

<b>Grandmother Turner</b>  Not clear if this is the Grandmother of Odie Strunk or Ellis (Wallace) Brown.  Seems to have passed on sometime before 1928 because the Historical society now has her journals. Reportedly cradle swapped Odie Strunk for Wallace Brown several times in 1871.<p>

<b>Officer O'Malley</b><br>  The police officer in seen in front of the Municipal building.<p>
